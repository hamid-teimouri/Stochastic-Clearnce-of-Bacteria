Understanding mechanisms of bacterial eradication is critically important for overcoming failures of antibiotic treatments. 
Current studies suggest that the clearance of large bacterial populations proceeds deterministically, while for smaller
populations, the stochastic effects become more relevant. 
We develop a theoretical approach to investigate the bacterial population dynamics under the effect of antibiotic drugs 
using a method of first-passage processes.

It allows us to explicitly evaluate the most important characteristics of bacterial clearance dynamics such as extinction 
probabilities and extinction times. We explored Monte Carlo computer simulations to evaluate the dynamic properties of 
stochastic bacterial clearance using Gillespie Algorithm.
